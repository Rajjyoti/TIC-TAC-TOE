# TIC-TAC-TOE
Created a Tic Tac Toe game using jupyter notebook and later saved as .py file.

Conditions:

2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.

I created the Functions for the various calls the player is asked to make and then used iteration to run the game.
